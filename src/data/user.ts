  about: `
Hello! I'm Anish Prashun — a passionate Software Engineer and Team Leader with 5+ years of experience building scalable, high-performance applications.

Currently leading development at XAMTAC CONSULTING LLC, where I spearheaded creation of an AI-powered marketing ERP system driving 25% increase in client conversion rates and supporting 1K+ daily active users. I've architected key features that led to 35% increase in platform adoption and 30% boost in client retention.

I specialize in full-stack development using React, Next.js, Node.js, TypeScript, and modern cloud technologies. As a Team Lead, I mentor 14-member development teams while managing high-value client deliverables for companies like Poshmom E-Commerce and TalkTales Entertainment.

My experience spans from AI-driven telecommunication platforms at Attack Capital (YCombinator W22) to performance optimization work with The Volte, where I reduced JavaScript bundle size by 40% and improved core web vitals by 130%.

I'm also passionate about creating solutions that impact students and businesses — from building virtual lab environments to developing mental health platforms. I'm a Smart India Hackathon Winner and hold Intellectual Property Rights for projects impacting 10,000+ students across India.

Let's connect and build something amazing together!
