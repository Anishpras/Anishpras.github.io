## My SIH Journey

As a winner of Smart India Hackathon 2022, I've seen what works and what doesn't. Our team won despite not having time to create an entire prototype. The key? We had a great team and we **solved the core issue**.

Having reviewed numerous submissions since then, I've noticed patterns in both successful and unsuccessful teams. Here are my insights to help you succeed in SIH 2025.

## Critical Tips for SIH 2025

### 1. Address Every Word in the Problem Statement

Carefully study and address **every word** in the official problem statement. If you drift away from this, even a great solution won't get selected. This is non-negotiable.

### 2. Keep Your Tech Stack Practical

Use technologies that are necessary. Judges care more about how your tech solves the problem, not how fancy your stack is. Avoid the temptation to add buzzwords or trendy frameworks just for show.

### 3. Master Your Presentation Structure

Each slide should focus on one key message. Avoid paragraphs, use bullet points, diagrams, and charts for clarity. Structure your presentation to cover:

- Title & Problem
- Solution Overview
- Technical Approach
- Feasibility
- Impact
- Research/References

### 4. Use AI Tools Wisely

Judges can spot recycled or AI-generated content. Use AI for support, but ensure your content is original and specific to your solution.

### 5. Show Working Prototypes

Add a working prototype screenshot, video, or even a test use case. Visual proof of your solution working is worth more than pages of theoretical explanation.

## Common Mistakes That Lead to Rejection

### 1. Overcomplicating Solutions

Many teams overcomplicate their solutions, using too many technologies or buzzwords, losing sight of what really matters. Remember: simplicity that solves the problem beats complexity that confuses.

### 2. Solving the Wrong Problem

Some teams do not fully solve the actual problem statement. Instead, they drift towards broader or unrelated issues. Stay laser-focused on the specific challenge given.

### 3. Missing the Official Template

A surprising number of teams miss the official template and lose valuable points on structure and clarity. Always use the provided format.

### 4. Over-reliance on AI for Content

Worryingly, many teams rely too heavily on AI tools for content, which leads to generic and less compelling submissions. Your unique insights and specific solutions matter more than perfect grammar.

### 5. Track Misalignment

There are cases of misaligned submissions, for example, submitting for Track 1 when their solution fits Track 2. Understand the tracks thoroughly before choosing.

### 6. Missing Prototypes

Missing prototypes, no video, no screenshot, nothing. This is a critical error that immediately puts you at a disadvantage.

## Understanding the Evaluation Criteria

Based on the evaluation criteria, here's where you should focus your efforts:

### Innovation/Novelty in Approach (20%)

- Originality of idea and concept
- Use of novel methods and approaches

### Technology (15%)

- Integration of advanced tools or technology
- Technical feasibility and practicality

### MVP/Prototype/Demo (15%)

- Demonstration of a working demo or prototype
- Proof of concept and development readiness

### Criticality/Impact (25%)

- Importance of the problem being solved
- Potential societal, industry, or research impact

### Commercial Viability & Cost-Effectiveness (25%)

- Market potential and business feasibility
- Affordability and scalability of the solution

## Final Thoughts

SIH is about solving real problems with practical solutions. Focus on understanding the problem deeply, building a working prototype (even if basic), and presenting your solution clearly.

Remember what helped us win in 2022: we didn't have the most complete prototype, but we understood and solved the core issue. That's what judges are looking for.

Good luck with SIH 2025! Focus on impact, stay practical, and let your solution speak for itself.
