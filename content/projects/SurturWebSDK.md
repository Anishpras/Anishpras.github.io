Surtur is a push notification service like Onesignal with a few different features that are implemented according to SabaIdea's products' needs. I've developed a web SDK for Surtur using TypeScript for adding Push Notification feature to SabaIdea's products' website such as [Aparat](https://aparat.com) and [Filimo](https://filimo.com).
