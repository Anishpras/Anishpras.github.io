I developed an admin panel for Surtur to monitor and manage apps, users, campaigns, notifications, and etc.
It's highly similar to the Onesignal panel with some different customized fields base on SabaIdea's products' needs.
Due to the fact that this is an internal application for SabaIdea I can't provide any username and password to preview this application.
