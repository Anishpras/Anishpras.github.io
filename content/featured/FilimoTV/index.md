I've developed this application for Filimo to discover and show movies on smart TV browsers such as LG WebOS TVs and Samsung Tizen TVs using ReactJS.
It is highly optimized for TV browsers, compatible with low-performance devices, supports TV remote keys, and uses the HLS protocol to stream movies.
Other SabaIdea products that built using this project's source code include
[Aparat TV](https://tv.aparat.com),
[Televika TV](https://tv.televika.com), and
[Filimo School TV](https://tv.filimo.school).
