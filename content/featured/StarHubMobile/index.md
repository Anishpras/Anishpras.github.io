This application and its web server were developed by me based on my own idea.
StarHub allowed developers to discover and review new GitHub repositories and showcase their own repositories to the others and gain real GitHub stars from real developers.
This application is no longer maintains because GitHub no longer offers any API to manage user stars and the IOS app was removed from the iPhone app store due to US sanctions for Iranian but you can see the android app on Google Play store.
